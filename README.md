# UT-Austin-Econ-Dept-Beamer-Template
by Zhenning Zhao at UT Austin

This beamer template is built based on heedonggoh's project (link: https://github.com/heedonggoh/UTBeamerTemplate). Changes were made to adjust for the economics department.

User’s guide:

1. Update Latex package before running
2. Change the Author’s name and the name of the conference at line 31 and 32.
3. Change the file “slides.tex” to change the content
4. Work best with VS code

This template is colored based on UT Brand Guide (http://www.utexas.edu/brand-guidelines).

Update History:

- 2020/7/29: update the package for citation (Beamer doesn't work with natbib, use cite package instead)
